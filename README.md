<!-- ### The Problem
<p>Job platforms like indeed, linkedIn etc allows me to set email notifications for new jobs.. But most times I end up receiving hundreds of emails each week..Then I'll spend minutes to hours going through these jobs to see the ones I like.. This is not making me productive at all.. I needed something more personalized or filtered in other to reduce the amount of jobs notifications I get daily and the time I will have to spend going through each of.</p> -->
